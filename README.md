A school project developing an engaging, responsive website for the Community Science Museum utilizing HTML/CSS.

## Description

The task was to create a website for a fictional interactive science museum. The key age demographics was ages 5-14 and families. The website was supposed to be informative, appealing for the young without pandering, engaging and encourage viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive across various devices.

Based on the first-semester curriculum, the project should reflect our creative and technical knowledge and skills with design principles, project management, communication technology and development using HTML/CSS.

The target audience should be carefully considered, and the proposed design should reflect this. A website prototype should be made using your chosen software, I used Figma.

The site was tested on a variety of devices before final delivery.

### Requirements

- The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.
- The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
- Compositional principles, typography, and color schemes must be considered.
- Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
- The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
- The site should download quickly and not be overly “heavy”. Images should be at most 200kb.
- The site should consider WCAG principles, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation, and colour usage.
- The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on various devices.
- The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of meta tags and alt text)
