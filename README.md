                        <p>major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
                        <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                    <p>
                        Did you know that not all dinosaurs were big and scary? Some were actually quite small, like the size of a chicken or even smaller! Dinosaurs came in all shapes and sizes, just like animals do today.</p>

                    <p>Did you know that DNA is like a genetic instruction book that tells living things how to grow and survive? Over a very long time, small changes in DNA can add up, leading to new traits and even new species in the process of evolution!</p>

                    <p>Did you know that the Big Bang is how scientists think the universe began? It was like a gigantic explosion that happened billions of years ago, and from it, everything in the universe, including stars, planets, and even us, eventually formed! </p>

                    <p>Did you know that forests are like Earth's lungs? They breathe in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which is what we need to breathe and live. So, forests are super important for keeping the air clean and our planet healthy!</p>
